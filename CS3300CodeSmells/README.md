## Introduction

Welcome to the CS300 Code Smells Assignment. 
This project consists of a series of Java classes that are part of a simulated e-commerce application. 
The application includes various functionalities such as customer management, product management, order processing, inventory management, and user authentication. 
The primary objective of this assignment is to examine the provided code, identify potential "code smells," and suggest improvements.

Setting Up the Environment:

2. #### Open IntelliJ IDEA
     - Within IntelliJ, you can choose the JDK of your preference. If you don't have a JDK installed, IntelliJ can assist you in downloading and setting up one.

3. #### Project Initialization:
    - In IntelliJ, open the extracted project folder.
    - Wait for the IDE to index and set up the project. This might take a few moments the first time.

4. #### Running the Application:
    - The main class of the application is the Runner class.
    - Locate the Runner class in the project structure.
    -  Right-click on the Runner class and select 'Run Runner.main()' to start the execution of the program.

## Extra Notes
- Make sure to reference Lectures 18 and 19 to aid in finding any code smells.
- Reference the rubric on Canvas to make sure you get full point for the assignment.
- The code serves no real purpose except boilerplate, the main objective is to find where the code can be improved.
